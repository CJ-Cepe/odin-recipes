    <p>Adobong mani is a popular Filipino snack that consists of fried peanuts with garlic. 
        It is easy to make and very addictive. You can enjoy it as an appetizer, a side dish, or a munchie. 
        Here is how to make adobong mani at home.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams of raw shelled peanuts (with or without skin)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of peeled garlic cloves, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add garlic and fry until golden and crisp, stirring occasionally. 
            Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same oil, fry peanuts for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until 
            golden and crunchy. Drain excess oil and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt over the peanuts and toss well to coat evenly. Add the fried garlic and toss again.</li>
        <li>Serve hot or at room temperature. Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to a week.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You can add some red chili flakes or cayenne pepper if you like your adobong mani spicy.</li>
        <li>You can also use roasted peanuts instead of raw ones, but reduce the frying time to avoid burning them.</li>
        <li>You can use a deep-fryer or an air-fryer instead of a skillet if you prefer.</li>
        <li>You can also make adobong mani with other nuts such as cashews, almonds, or pistachios.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Enjoy your adobong mani with a cold drink or a hot cup of coffee. It is a perfect snack for any occasion. Try it today and let me know what you think!
