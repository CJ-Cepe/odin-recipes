    <p>If you are looking for a simple and delicious snack that you can make at home, 
        you will love this candied peanut recipe. Candied peanuts are crunchy, sweet, and 
        salty, and they only require two major ingredients: peanuts and sugar. You can also add 
        some salt or orange flower water for extra flavor, if you like. Here are the ingredients and 
        steps for making candied peanuts:</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of raw peanuts (with skin)</li>
        <li>1 cup of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of water</li>
        <li>A pinch of coarse salt (optional)</li>
        <li>A splash of orange flower water (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 300Â°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, combine the peanuts, sugar, and water. Stir constantly until the sugar dissolves and forms a syrup.</li>
        <li>Keep cooking and stirring for about 10 minutes, or until the syrup evaporates and the peanuts are coated with a sandy-textured sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and continue stirring as the sugar in the pan melts again and turns into a golden caramel. Be careful not to burn the caramel or make it too dark.</li>
        <li>When the caramel is light amber and the peanuts are glazed, remove from the heat and sprinkle with salt and orange flower water, if using. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Spread the peanuts in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet and let them cool and harden completely.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your candied peanuts as a snack or use them as a topping for ice cream, salads, or desserts. You can store them in an airtight container for up to a week.</li>
    </ol>
